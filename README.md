# Super Mario Run
This project is based on the original 2016 Super Mario Run mobile game developed and published by Nintendo for iOS devices.
Super Mario Run is a side-scrolling platformer which consists of 3 levels. The player controls Mario or other characters 
as they automatically run across the screen while timing jumps to kill enemies, dodge environmental obstacles, and collect
coins to purchase new characters or power ups. This game also consists of a developer mode which was created with the intention
of making it easier for us to determine object placement coordinates while creating a new level.
